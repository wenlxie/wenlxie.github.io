## Introduction

PROJECT Link and ReadMe:  https://github.com/cilium/pwru/

## Implementation

### eBPF progs

Defined 5 eBPF prog with skb_buff args in different field

https://github.com/cilium/pwru/blob/v0.0.6/bpf/kprobe_pwru.c#L383-L416

The other functions are:

- metadata related

  https://github.com/cilium/pwru/blob/v0.0.6/bpf/kprobe_pwru.c#L24-L32

- filter related

  https://github.com/cilium/pwru/blob/v0.0.6/bpf/kprobe_pwru.c#L266

- output related

  https://github.com/cilium/pwru/blob/v0.0.6/bpf/kprobe_pwru.c#L344

### Filter functions and args
    
- Get the functions which can be kprobed from '/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/available_filter_functions'
  (Only the function names, no args info)

- Get the functions from kmod from `/sys/kernel/btf/<modules>`
  
- Get the functions from vmlinux

- Get the functions with args sk_buff and its index which can be kprobed

- Link the functions to the bpf progs with kprobe 

### pwru usage

pwru uses kprobe  to hook for  more than 500 functions on the system if no function filter specified, which can be showed by `bpftool perf list`

It has performance impact , should not be used in production environment which has high traffic.
