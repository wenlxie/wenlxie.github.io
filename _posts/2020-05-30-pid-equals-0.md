excerpt: pid=0 in eBPF prog

## Phenomenon

When try to use helper function [bpf_get_current_pid_tgid](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/docs/reference_guide.md#4-bpf_get_current_pid_tgid)
to get current pid and tgid in the BCC prog, it always can see the pid=0 in the output when it be used to handle tracepoints/kprobe of network related functions.

## SoftIrq

Kernel handles softirq in two paths:
* irq_exit()->invoke_softirq() This is called after hardware interrupt 
* ksoftirqd->invoke_softirq() This is handled by ksoftirqd

When hardware IRQ interrupts the system during CPU is idle, then the pid used by bpf_get_current_pid_tgid() is 0. 

If many cpus are idle, and then you may get many pid=0 when call this helper function, so it is not uniq to use this pid_tgid as key for a map.
This may cause some events lost when you  don't remind of this. 

## Network Latency

For the handle paths of softirq, we can see that two common cases that can caused network latency.

* irq had been off for too long time
   
* ksoftirqd is blocked by other process runs on the CPU

There are tools that used to detect these two issues. 
For example:
* [trace_irqoff](https://github.com/bytedance/trace-irqoff)
* [trace_noschedule](https://github.com/bytedance/trace-noschedule)
