## Purpose
- Use MTR to trace the packet path from pod to pod 

## Issues
- When try to run mtr inside src pod's network namespace, it shows following error 

```
mtr -T xxxxx.com

My traceroute  [v0.93]
yyyyy.com (10.xxx.xxx.xxx)                                                                                                                                           2022-08-17T09:28:24+0000

 1. (no route to host)

```

But if we use UDP/ICMP to  probe the path instead of TCP, then mtr can show the full path as expectation
```

## Something happened when use TCP

Use tcpdump to capture for what happened when use TCP

```
03:09:02.112033 IP 10.xxx.xxx.xxx.35564 > xxxxxxxxxxx.com.http: Flags [S], seq 1656127004, win 64240, options [mss 1460,sackOK,TS val 784970555 ecr 0,nop,wscale 8], length 0

03:09:02.135481 IP yyyyyyyyyy.com > 10.18.196.21: ICMP xxxxxxxxxxx.com unreachable - need to frag (mtu 9000), length 36

```

The yyyyyyyyyy.com replied an ICMP packet with error: `unreachable - need to frag (mtu 9000), length 36`  when it received an IP packet with TTL=1

The formal packet should be: `ICMP time exceeded in-transit, length 72`

So if we set the --first-ttl to bypass that hop, then TCP probe works fine.

It is obviously that  mtr will handle the packets that received with indicate IP is unreachable

## MTR change to handle 'no route to host'
Iâ€˜d think that mtr not continue to do probe when it received such kind of ICMP error msg, so can mtr continue to do more found probe when it met this kind of issue ? Maintainer's reply: https://github.com/traviscross/mtr/issues/434#issuecomment-1220502725  

But after read the code and do tcpdump to trace the probe packets. Mtr will continue to do probe, but it didn't show the result when it met `no route to host` issue.  So if you want to show all the pathes, then you can change the code as:
https://github.com/wenlxie/mtr/commit/8a9baf561943f6229cbf936e376bced87e543d79

### Why use ICMP probe can't show the ECMP path
From tcpdump, we can see that there is only one device replied the ICMP packet for the ICMP ECHO with specific TTL, that means
- This is not MTR code error to handle the Multipath when USE ICMP
- Switchs' ECMP hash configuration for the ICMP should not use ID/SN field in ICMP header, but only use  SIP/DIP in our DC, that is why when run traceroute/mtr many times, the same route path will be discoverd.


### --report option not work
When use option --report to collect the reports, but the ECMP path info will be lost, need to upgrade MTR to higher version like 0.95
